            Problem description
        </h2>
        <p>
            The general topic we will be addressing is helping those who play video games having partners to play games with and work with. The main issue that is being addressed is helping to reduce the toxic gaming community where you are able to meet many random people online who have the ability to be toxic to whoever they meet. According to this <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity">article</a>, over 80% of multiplayer gamers recently experienced some form of toxicity
        </p>
        <p>
            An information technology problem that is related to this space is how there are many people who play video games have trouble finding partners/teammates who they are able to play video games with. People may join online games and be at a disadvantage when it comes to not having a teammate when many other people in the video game do have a teammate. Another issue that may occur is that when gamers play with random people online they may come across toxic people which may make them feel bad about themselves. Our app will allow people to find friendly teammates which they can talk to and play their favorite games with.
        </p>

            A similar app which attempts to solve this problem is <a href="https://gamerlinkapp.com">Gamerlinkapp</a>. Gamerlinkapp is an app designed to help users to find other people or groups to game with. There are 280+ games on the app and a chat messaging system to connect users.

        <h2>
            Proposed Application
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our application will be accessible to all people who play video games in North America. Anyone of any age is allowed to join the application; however if the user is below the age of 13, our website will require parental control to manage the user’s access. We also include users from any video game community so no one is left out from finding a teammate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will be able to view other users’ information that they have in their profile and information about what time people want to play a certain game. This will allow people to schedule when to find teammates for a certain video game. We will also allow users to flag their teammates for toxicity in order to warn others and reduce the toxic video game community. Users will be able to see who is online or offline unless the user uses a ghost mode option which makes it so other users of the application can’t see whether you are online or offline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application will contain two main sections: a profile section and a section to find teammates. The profile section will include many different things about you so you can find the perfect match. Parts of the profile include: username, description or a bio of oneself and what they are looking to do on the app, games that they are currently playing, games that they have played before, and games that they most enjoyed. The second feature to find teammates allows users to create different rooms for different games in order to find teammates who play similar games and play at the same time.
            This application will be a safe space where people can find friends and groups to play video games with. We will help solve the issue of toxicity in video games because users will be able to find teammates similar to them by viewing other people’s profiles. Users will also have the ability to flag someone that may be toxic so other users are warned before possibly playing a game with them.
